Qatar trusted AI Chatbot

## What it Does: 
AMAN is a chatbot developed specifically with a primary focus on upholding and preserving Qatar's policies. It is designed to adapt to various situations and environments, showcasing its versatility and compliance with local standards. This chatbot leverages advanced Large Language Model (LLM) technology to provide a reliable, safe, and interactive communication platform. Moreover, It incorporates sophisticated input and output filtering mechanisms to ensure all interactions adhere to Qatar's established policies and cultural norms.
As a use case,  AMAN is tailored to serves as an administrative assistant  for Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), providing a reliable and interactive communication platform. It is equipped to handle a wide array of queries related to university life, ensuring adherence to Qatar's established policies in every interaction.

# Who it Serves: 
AMAN is primarily developed to serve the students, and staff of HBKU. It aims to be an accessible digital assistant, providing instant responses to queries and facilitating an enhanced administrative experience. By being available 24/7, AMAN ensures that the university community has continuous access to essential information and support, regardless of their physical location or time zone. While AMAN is initially implemented for HBKU, its design allows for adaptation to different institutions and scenarios within Qatar.

# What We Aim to Achieve: 
What We Aim to Achieve: The development of AMAN aims to revolutionize the way information and support are provided within educational and other institutions in Qatar. Our objectives include:
Upholding Qatar's Policies: Ensuring all interactions are compliant with local policies and cultural norms, setting a standard for AI communication in Qatar.
Adaptability: Demonstrating AMAN's ability to adapt to different environments, starting with HBKU as a use case.
Enhancing Administrative Efficiency: By providing a 24/7 service, AMAN aims to overcome the limitations of traditional administrative methods, such as:
1) Issues with Traditional Methods:
2) Limited to working hours for responses.
3) Delays due to high administrative workload.
4) Time-consuming detailed responses.
# Proposed Solution with AMAN:
1) Availability for requests and responses 24/7.
2) Immediate, detailed responses without delays.
3) Reliable and accurate answers, reducing the need for follow-up queries.
4) Promoting Digital Safety and Innovation: Setting a benchmark in digital safety in AI communications and positioning Qatar as a leader in technological innovation in education and other sectors.

# System architecture
Our system comprises two main protection layers. One applied between LLM (Chatbot) and user input (prompt), and the other applied better the Chatbot (raw generated output)  and  the user (the final output)

# The goal: 
we need to provide Qatar-based reliable, Policies and Values- complaint Chatbot.

# Motivation: 
Existing Chatbots trained to be aligned with generic policies and values. Different regions/countries/communities have their own values. We aim to provide a chatbot variation that developed considering Qatar policies and values. 

In addition, existing chatbots were not trained on private dataset for privacy and/or accessibility challenges. incorporating private datasets to serve specific audience/community will make chatbot more appeal.
Therefore, our proposed solution consider providing fine-tuned chatbot that is trained on private data, considering protections against data leaking and other privacy concerns.
